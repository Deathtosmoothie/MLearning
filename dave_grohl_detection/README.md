# Dave Grohl detection

Detection and localizing Dave Grohl from Foo Fighters, using Deep Learning.

Technology used: Google Colaboratory, tensorflow, Google Object Detection API.

## Getting started

* Download one of the pre-trained models from https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md

* Create Google Drive account and upload all files from this repository and pre-trained model folder.

* Launch dave_grohl_detection.ipynb in Google Colaboratory and run all cells.

In the end you will get the frozen graph, which you can test by your own images from test_images folder.
